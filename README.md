# 🎴 Trading Card Discord Bot

This is my **Trading Card Discord Bot**, a customizable system where users can collect, trade, and earn virtual cards.  
You can use this as a base for your own project — the structure is flexible, and you can easily modify it to match your own schema or theme.

My implementation uses **family and personal photos** as the card images, but you can substitute these with any images of your choice.

## 🗃️ Database Overview

The bot uses a few main tables to manage data:

- **CardsGeneral** — stores metadata for each card type  
- **Cards** — stores specific instances of cards owned by users  
- **Users** — stores user balances and data  
- **Packs** — defines packs that can be opened  
- **VoucherRewards**, **Questions**, **SetRewards**, and **Codes** — additional systems for special rewards and bonuses  

> 💡 The current version assumes the user interacting with the bot is already registered in the database.

You can tweak your own odds by modifying:
- The `rolls` variable in the code
- The end condition of the iteration or `while` loop

This allows full control over pack rarity balance and reward distribution.
