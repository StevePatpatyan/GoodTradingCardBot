This is my trading card discord bot. The following code should be good to use for anyone. I have the trading cards as images of family including myself.

The database schema I use involves the general card info table as well as the table of specific cards tied to an owner and number out of the total of that particular card type. One can modify the code for themselves to fit a different schema!
